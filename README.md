Windows Users:\
It is recommended to have pyperclip installed, although
not completely necessary. For more guidance, visit
https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/,
or simply do "pip install pyperclip" in the terminal.

To run the program, navigate to this directory via the
terminal and simply type in "python Main.py"
and a window should pop up. If not, please contact me.
